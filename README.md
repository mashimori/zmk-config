# ZMK Config

## Getting started

Step into a new realm of control with your [Urchin Keyboard](https://github.com/duckyb/urchin) and my custom ZMK keymap. This quick guide will walk you through the process, ensuring your keyboard performs exactly how you envision.

- **Repository Initialization**: Start by creating a fork of this repository on your GitHub account.
- **Continuous Integration Activation**: Enable GitHub Actions within your forked repository. This is crucial for automated firmware compilation.
- **Keymap Modification**: Edit the `urchin.keymap` file. For a complete understanding of available options, consult the [ZMK Codes reference](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes)
- **Firmware Generation**: After making your modifications, execute a git push operation. GitHub Actions will automatically commence the compilation process. Upon successful completion, the compiled firmware file will be available in the "Assets" section of the corresponding action.
